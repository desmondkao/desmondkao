Hi there, I’m Desmond Kao! I’m interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, software development, psychology, philosophy, and exploring the intersection of technology and human behavior. I’m currently learning advanced AI techniques, data visualization, scalable system design, psychology, and philosophy. I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve AI-driven innovation, open-source tools, and impactful problem-solving in tech or healthcare. You can reach me via email at dmk9535@nyu.edu or on LinkedIn at Desmond Kao. A fun fact about me is that I’ve been playing classical piano for years and love diving into complex compositions.
